This project is to create an interactive sketch tool using Javascript. The main challenge will be to create multiple divs in a grid via Javascript according to the user input.

Currently, I have no idea exactly how this will be achieved but keen to give it a go. I'm thinking that I will have to use the repeat function in the grid making section so may have to revise some CSS stuff on the way.
